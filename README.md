# Arduino Projects
It was created using sensors such as Arduino, Leds, Buzzer, Button, Distance Sensor, Servo, Seven Segment.

Description of the Projects:

1) Seven Segment Control with Button: While one button increases the numbers, the other button serves to decrease the numbers.

2) Led Control with Button: While the LEDs are lit sequentially in one direction, when you press and hold the button, the LEDs will start to light in the opposite direction.

3) RGB Led Control with Distance Sensor: The LED will turn on in red, green and blue colors according to the determined distances.

4) Turning on LEDs with Distance Sensor, Using Buzzer: LEDs will turn on according to the determined distances. When it falls below the specified distance, the buzzer will also sound.

5) Servo Motor Control with Potentiometer: The servo motor will move according to the value read from the potentiometer.

6) Seven Segment Display: It will print the numbers from zero to nine on the seven segment display.
